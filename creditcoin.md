I operate a Creditcoin Validator and manage a GitHub repo with some (hopefully) helpful and interesting information about running your own Creditcoin validator, useful links and some other stuff. You can find that here: [Creditcoin-Info](https://github.com/wi-ry/Creditcoin-Info)

If you'd like to learn more about Creditcoin, visit [Creditcoin.org](https://www.creditcoin.org), or join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/creditcoin).
