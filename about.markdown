<p style="font-size: 1.5em">Will wants to live in a world where everyone is treated equally, play is more important than work, people have a good sense of humour and there are at least nine squirrels within walking distance at all times.</p>

For the past 18ish years, Will has lived in The Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada.

As a [photographer](/photos/), he’s been applauded by his mother, friends and cats. His photography is on display in both hemispheres, and perhaps some day they will reach even further.

When he’s not working or drinking caffeine in some form, you can find him wishing he had/spent more of his time doing photography, burning his way through 10,000 steps a day (Not doing this often enough), helping write books, volunteering within his community and complete a tech certification every now and then.

Causes which are close to his heart are the [Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.ca), the [Canadian Mental Health Association](http://www.cmha.ca), and [Crohn’s and Colitis Canada](https://crohnsandcolitis.ca/).
