<p style="font-size: 1.5em">Will wants to live in a world where everyone is treated equally, play is more important than work, people have a good sense of humor and there are at least nine squirrels within walking distance at all times.</p>

For the past 18ish years, Will has lived in New Westminster, British Columbia. Located at the center of Metro Vancouver on the banks of the Fraser River, New Westminster is the place to be. As the oldest city in western Canada, and the first capital of British Columbia, the “Royal City” has a proud heritage.

As a [photographer](/photos/), he’s been applauded by his mother, friends and cats. His photography is on display in both hemispheres, and perhaps some day they will reach even further.

When he’s not working or drinking caffeine in some form, you can find him wishing he had/spent more of his time doing photography, burning his way through 10,000 steps a day (Not doing this often enough), or trying his darnedest to learn enough to finally complete a few Microsoft certification exams (I did this in 2021!)

Causes which are close to his heart are the [Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.ca), the [Canadian Mental Health Association](http://www.cmha.ca), and [Crohn’s and Colitis Canada](https://crohnsandcolitis.ca/)
