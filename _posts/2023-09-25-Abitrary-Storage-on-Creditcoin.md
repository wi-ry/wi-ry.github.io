I've added a new page to my [Creditcoin Info](https://github.com/wi-ry/Creditcoin-Info) repo, called [Abitrary File Storage on Creditcoin Blockchain](https://github.com/wi-ry/Creditcoin-Info/blob/main/Abitrary-File-Storage.md), which looks at how the Creditcoin blockchain can be used to store files, and how to recover them.

I also created a [Creditcoin-MonitorBlocksForRemarks](https://github.com/wi-ry/Creditcoin-MonitorBlocksForRemarks) repo that contains a Node.js application which will download System.Remark files from the Creditcoin blockchain.

Pretty interesting stuff. What have you built on top of web3 recently? I'd love to hear what you're working on! Add me on [Discord](discordapp.com/users/wi_ry)
