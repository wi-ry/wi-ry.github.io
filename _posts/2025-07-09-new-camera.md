Good news -- I finally got a new camera!! I recently acquired a EOS Rebel T5 and should start posting more photography again soon.

Here's my current cameras:
| Brand | Model | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | -------------|
| Canon | Rebel XT | Older SLR, but shoots raw which I'm told is good |
| Canon | SX50     | Good general purpose camera with 50x zoom |
| Canon | Rebel T5 | My shiny new SLR, it has a lot of nice features and a big bag! |
